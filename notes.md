Notes while converting
======================

Potential Amendments
--------------------

Ideas I had for potential amendments

- `Article III: meetings` starts to meander into attendance to all events, not just meetings. Consider revising.
- Add something about the bylaws being stored in github, as well as other bookkeeping type stuff
- Potentially Revise ammendments with new procedure for git-style bylaws amendments
- For completeness' sake, add section to `Article II` about the different kinds of vote (yea, nay, abstain)
- Potentially codify the 2-votes for the pledges thing in the bylaws, since we do it every semester anyway
- Add an "unaffiliated" membership type, for comepleteness?
- `Article IV, Section 1`: Add more detail about EI numbers
- What is the point of this line: "Member must have paid his International dues and Chapter social dues."?
- Add that inactives transition to alumni when they graduate
- Remove redundant description of non-pledges becoming undergrads
- Create a more uniform wording for the different membership catagories. In many cases, the wording differs between catagories, even though the intent is essentiall identical.
- Remove passage about secret election ballots
- Runoff voting
- Fix wording in some J-board sections for clairity
    - Are elections 2 weeks before or after initiation?
    - Make it more clear who votes for what in J-board elections
- Make it explicit that there must be at least one election for each election per year
- There is a redundancy in stating who is allowed to hold an office- it is described in both the membership article and the officeres article. Consider revising.
- Add explict rules about resignation
- Add Faculty Advisor Liason
- So I guess Appointed positions are approved by Class A vote? Maybe change that?
-IN GENERAL: wherever possible, change things to be the way we do them anyway. Having the bylaws say one thing and convention another is stupid.
- Under summer house manager: wtf does "Shall be responsible for ensuring “continuity” of Chapter operations" mean.
- Define disciplinary action
- Only class members can NOMINATE and vote for jboard elections
- WTF is social dues

Unilateral Amendments
---------------------

Things that are more significant than simple organisational amendments, but aren't at the level of content changes. Usually these are changes to passages for clairity or the removal of redundant passages

- Specify exactly the procedure for honerary membership, rather than referencing the pledge and undergrad sections numbers
- Removed the part about Excused members being allowed to run for office but not hold it because it's stupid
    - On further consideration, I readded that stuff, clairifying that excused members may run in elections for offices they will hold when they return to RPI
- Simplified wording of Excused Membership qualifications
- Wherever possible, removed nested numbering under sections. In particular, created a distinction between headers and content.
- Split Elected House Offices into Major and Minor.
- Moved the passage about assistants
- Moved J-board caveats to a separate subsection.
- Risk Manager's duties and powers were listed under the header "House Manager"
- Moved Appointed positions rules to above the duties list
- Removed distinction between volunteer committee and elected committee
- Erased Article VII, Section 5, B, which recurses forever.
- Rearranged Article IX. Added sections etc
- Removed empty Amendments article
- *Significantly* rearranged the Scholarship Policy stuff
- Removed signature stuff at the bottom

What does "X" mean?
-------------------

List of things that didn't make sense when I read them, or need to be seriously clarified so as not to be completely meaningless.

- Active Membership Subsequent Qualifications: "Member must have paid his International dues and Chapter social dues."
    - Specifically, what happens when this is not the case?
- Article V, Section 4: "The most senior ranking officer present in the Chapter House is ultimately responsible for all domestic activity"
    - I know this refers to the Bubba chain, but can we get an actual ruling about how it actually works? Like talk to a lawyer or something?
- Summer House Manager: "Shall be responsible for ensuring “continuity” of Chapter operations"
- Executive Committee: "May make decisions concerning the Chapter, which are valid until the next Chapter meeting at which point they must be brought to the attention of the brotherhood."
- Scholarship Policy: "...Any officer who falls below this threshold is subject to review for continued office."
