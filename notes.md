Notes while converting
======================

This document contains things I noticed in the bylaws that we should consider amending.

- `Article III: meetings` starts to meander into attendance to all events, not just meetings. Consider revising.
- Add something about the bylaws being stored in github, as well as other bookkeeping type stuff
- Potentially Revise ammendments with new procedure for git-style bylaws amendments
- For completeness' sake, add section to `Article II` about the different kinds of vote (yea, nay, abstain)
- Potentially codify the 2-votes for the pledges thing in the bylaws, since we do it every semester anyway
- Add an "unaffiliated" membership type, for comepleteness?
- `Article IV, Section 1`: Add more detail about EI numbers
- What is the point of this line: "Member must have paid his International dues and Chapter social dues."?
- Add that inactives transition to alumni when they graduate
